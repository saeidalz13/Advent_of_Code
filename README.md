# Solutions of Advent of Code:

* Each folder contains a .py script alongside the relevant inputs and outputs
* Each problem has 2 sections. The solutions to different sections are either in a single output or in their corresponding output file.

# NOTE:
Problems 1,2, and 5 have been re-written in a more computationally-efficient way. So, you will find two different .py scripts for them.
